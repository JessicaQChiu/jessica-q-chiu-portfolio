      <h2>Who am I?</h2>
      <p className="ml-6 mb-4">
        Self-taught developer with a focus on front-end development and digital
        accessibility. New Zealand IT/business graduate with professional
        experience working as an analyst in the financial technology industry.
        Freelance artist.
        <br />
        <br />
        With a background in art, business, finance, and IT, I can bring a
        diverse and creative insight to development projects. I strive to craft
        inclusive and innovative digital spaces and experiences.
        <br />
        <br />
        The COVID-19 lockdown helped me recognise the importance of being online
        - studying, working, and connecting with others. This also highlighted
        the issues of digital accessibility which inspired me to begin learning
        web development. I quickly came to realise how programming embodies the
        things I love and enjoy which encouraged me to pursue it as a career.
        <br />
        <br />
        When I&apos;m offline, you can find me reading with a cup of tea,
        painting, or playing board games.
